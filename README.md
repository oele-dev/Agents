# AI Code Assistant Guidelines

A comprehensive collection of development guidelines and best practices for AI code assistants working with modern web development stacks.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains detailed guidelines for AI assistants to follow when working on projects using various technology stacks. The guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality code development following industry best practices.

## 🚀 Technology Stacks Covered

### Core Guidelines
- **[Agents.md](./agents.md)** - Main guidelines and core principles for all AI assistants
- **[Laravel & PHP](./laravel-php-guidelines.md)** - Comprehensive Laravel and PHP development guidelines

### Specialized Stacks
- **[TALL Stack](./TALL.md)** - Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, Laravel
- **[RILT Stack](./RILT.md)** - React, Inertia.js, Laravel, Tailwind CSS
- **[Filament PHP](./FilamentPHP.md)** - Filament admin panel framework for Laravel

## 📖 How to Use

### For AI Assistants
1. **Always start by reading the main [Agents.md](./agents.md) file**
2. **Identify the project's technology stack** by analyzing dependencies
3. **Read the corresponding specialized guidelines** for your identified stack
4. **Follow all mandatory rules** including authorization requirements and documentation standards

### For Developers
- Use these guidelines to train or configure AI assistants for your projects
- Reference specific stack guidelines when working with particular technologies
- Ensure your AI assistants follow the authorization and documentation requirements

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### Authorization Required
**AI assistants must only proceed with actions or commands after receiving explicit authorization from the user.**

### Step-by-Step Documentation
**For every change requested, AI assistants must provide a detailed step-by-step guide with specifics of every change made.**
