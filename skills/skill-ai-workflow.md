# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Skill

## Core Philosophy
- **AI IS A TOOL**: We are Tony Stark, AI is Jarvis. We direct, it executes.
- **CONCEPTS > CODE**: Understand fundamentals before implementing
- **SOLID FOUNDATIONS**: Design patterns, architecture, bundlers before frameworks
- **AGAINST IMMEDIACY**: No shortcuts. Real learning takes effort and time.

## Effective AI Collaboration

### Context Provision
- Provide clear, specific requirements
- Include relevant file paths and code context
- Specify technology stack and versions
- Mention constraints and preferences upfront

### Iterative Development
1. Start with architecture and design
2. Implement in small, testable increments
3. Review and refine with AI assistance
4. Validate understanding before proceeding

### Code Review with AI
- Ask for security analysis (OWASP top 10)
- Request performance optimization suggestions
- Verify pattern compliance
- Check for edge cases and error handling

## Prompting Strategies

### Effective Prompts
- Be specific about what you want
- Provide examples of desired output
- Specify constraints and requirements
- Ask for explanations, not just code

### Ineffective Prompts
- Vague requests without context
- Asking for code without understanding
- Skipping architecture and design phase
- Accepting code without review

## AI Workflow Patterns

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand**: Verify the problem before solving
2. **Design**: Plan the solution architecture
3. **Implement**: Write code with AI assistance
4. **Verify**: Test and validate the solution
5. **Refine**: Iterate based on feedback

### Learning with AI
- Ask for explanations of concepts
- Request alternatives with tradeoffs
- Challenge AI suggestions with "why?"
- Use AI to explore unfamiliar domains

## Meta-Programming Patterns

### File-Based Configuration
- Use .md files for AI instructions
- Create skill-based modular systems
- Version control AI configuration
- Document patterns and conventions

### Skill Detection
- Trigger skills based on file extensions
- Load multiple skills for hybrid stacks
- Maintain skill dependencies and versions
- Update skills as frameworks evolve

## Best Practices
1. **Verify Claims**: Don't accept AI output blindly
2. **Understand Code**: Review before accepting
3. **Test Everything**: AI-generated code needs testing
4. **Document Decisions**: Capture reasoning in commits/docs
5. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Accepting code without understanding it
- Skipping tests for AI-generated code
- Over-relying on AI for architecture decisions
- Not verifying security implications
- Ignoring performance considerations

## Tools & Techniques
- Use AI for boilerplate generation
- Leverage AI for documentation writing
- Get AI assistance for debugging
- Use AI for code refactoring suggestions
- Ask AI to explain complex codebases
